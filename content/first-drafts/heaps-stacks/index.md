# Memory Allocation

## Stack
The stack part of the memory is set aside for the thread of execution. It's used to store the order of the functions and methods getting called.

When a function is called, some memory is reserved on the top of the stack for local variables and bookkeeping data. The stack always returns a LIFO, last in, first out.

## Heap

The heap is memory set aside for dynamic allocation. There is no enforced patter to the allocation and deallocation of blocks from the hep.

Allocation and deallocation can be done at any time.

# Data Structures
## Stack
A linear data structure.

## Heap
A hierarchical data structure. A heap is similar to a binary tree, except a binary tree is ordered.
