This is a tiny article. It's more like my notes on me learning statistics. I am watching a Free Code Camp course on statistics and writing up the information. Here is the link to the course. You might find my notes useful. Sometimes we don't need the entire course, just a quick answer. If you need the entire course, feel free to watch it instead. It's pretty darn good.

## Types of Data

Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics
Descriptive statistics is a set of information that summarizes a given data set.

Inferential data allows a person to make predictions or infere meaning from that same given data set.

Data can be thought of as fitting into one of two categories, quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data can be recognized easily as numbers and qualitative data are categories or description of data.

This is an overly simplistic explanation, but it gets the point across. Quantitative, I have 5 shirts. Qualitative, I have a yellow shirt.

#### Quantititative:
Interval: a space between two things, no true zero. Think of it as a range.
Ratio data: true zero exists. Think of it as a scale.

#### Qualitative:
Nominal: no ordering or direction
Ordinal: data that can be ordered and categorized.

### Sampling

Small section of the population so we can infer the aspects of the whole population.

Sampling frame: part of the population from which you want to draw a sample.

Undercoverage: omitting population members from the sampling frame.

Sampling error: (fact of life) the population mean will be different from you sample mean.
The population percentage will probably be different from you sample percentage. Just the error that is inevitable.

Non-sampling error: using a bad list. To avoid: be sure that everyone in the population should be in the sampling frame. Bad design of the sample.

Simulation: numerical fake representation of a real world phenomenon.

Simple Random Sampling (SRS): n measurements where every subset of the population selected in such a magger that every sample of size n had an equal chance of being selected.

Stratified Sampling: sampling that first divides the groups into strata.

Limitations: you can over sample any one group.

Systematic sampling: arrange all the individuals of a population in a particular order. Then pick a random individual as a start. Step three, then take every kth member of the population in the sample.

Limitations: you can't do this when there is a pattern to the data.

Periodicity: you have to worry about this with systematic sampling, but it's not very often.

Cluster Sampling: why do we need so many samplings? Because clustering is special. If you have a problem that might need a particular geographic location.

Sometimes the people located in a cluster are all so similar in a way that makes the problem hard to understand.

Convenience Sampling: Using results or data that are conveniently located or readily obtained.

Multistage Sampling: Combination of sampling of strategies layered in stages. Usually multi-stage sampling happens in large governmental agencies.
