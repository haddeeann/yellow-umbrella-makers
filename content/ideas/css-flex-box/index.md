The CSS display property for designers was revolutionary when it came out. It has since became a standard go to tool when developers want to take a number of items and just magically distribute them in a pattern. And there's lots of patterns you can use and do.

But first, the basics need to be learned. So there are two main categories of a flex box based layout. First, the parent component receives the property of display: flex-box. Next, various attributes can be applied to the parent container to control the overall display of the layout. 

Next, for a more fine tuned layout, each child of the parent html element can also have flex box styles that control their individual layout.
