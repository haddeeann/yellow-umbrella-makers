Hooks are functions and you import them. This has been marketed as something crazy in React land. But they are just functions. The special part is that React has built in functions that do the things that you used to have to do with classes and state.

Take the state object. It used to be that you could only use state in a class. By adding a functional hook called useState, a react object can then use the useState function/hook to add state to their project.
